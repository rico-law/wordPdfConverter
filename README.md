# wordPdfConverter
A simple electron app to convert Word to PDF files.
This app currently uses docto (https://github.com/tobya/DocTo) to convert word files to PDF files for now. 
Docto requires an installation of MS Word as it uses Office's native conversion tp create PDF files from Word documents.
